This is my example page for markdown.
You can make italic text and bold text.
There are different heading sizes.

Other things you can do in markdown are make lists.
* This
* is
* a
* list
 
Here is another way to make lists, these are numbered.
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

You can make inline code or blockquotes.
`Inline code is awesome`
>So are blockquotes

>See?

But you can also make blocks of code using this
```
this is a larger code block
it is multiline
```
